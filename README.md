# tryReflex
functional reactive programming (FRP) with Haskell

I thought Haskell might be more fun to learn if we tried to build a website. There is not much documentation, just a few quickreferences,
[[1](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex/blob/develop/Quickref.md), [2](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex/blob/develop/Quickref.md)] the source code iself and off you go.
There are lots and lots and lots of monads ([3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fohXBj2UEI), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8) )(at least not for the programmer). 

Also, the Elm [compiler](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/tree/master/src) is written in Haskell and compiles Elm language files
into JavaScript in a reliable way.

Elm is a functional programming language, but it does not use monads   And it is almost exclusively
about web programming.  Haskell can be used for web or desktop.  It can be used in front-end or back-end.  Can even chomp up 
substantial backend computations and do them in the web browser.

None of the applications of these are useful.  Purely test-driving the language. [Demo](https://monsieurcactus.github.io/tryReflex/candy/)
